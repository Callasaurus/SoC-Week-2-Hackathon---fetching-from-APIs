# Week 2 API fetching hackathon

This is an app created at the end of week 2 of the School of Code course. We were briefed to fetch data from an API and create something with it. Given my love for dad jokes, this app was the perfect fit. I hadn't seen a line of code 2 weeks previous to this, so I was really happy with this and how it was created in one day.
